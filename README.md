smart contract to hold energy from donaters

awareness symbol defined (say X)

proof of creation of X somewhere (and seen by someone) allows this proover to take get some energy from the smart contract

how much energy? its market ... proover submits a value and community votes y/n ... proover should start with a too high value, lowering after every n vote
this allows for complex valuation whilst minimizing effort of community

there is a core of the community that holds veto ... usually broad community votes
creator of community can add/remove vetoers

this allows for a system for donaters to reward the dissemination of symbol X in the world ... to induce any desired change
